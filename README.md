# Final_Project_CMPS413

A chat application utilizing java and sockets to create a simple chat application with clients, and servers.
Each Client connects to the server and is able to chat with other users and the users are able to see each other and send messages within the chat room.
This application was created as part of my CMPS 413, computer networking final project.

## Running the Project

### Server

- Start a command line window using 'java Server {portNum}'

### Client

- In another window, type 'java Client localhost {portNum}'.
- Once connected as a client, you should be able to see a prompt asking you to enter a user.
- Enter your username and begin chatting!
